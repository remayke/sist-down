<b>sist-down</b> - short for Sistlev Downloader.<br/><br/>
This was a program created in one day to solve some of the internal network problems at <strong>DNIT</strong> (National Department of Infrastructure  and Transport), where the engineering team could not visualize and evaluate the images and videos stored on the servers due to the large flow of requests. <br/><br/>
To solve this problem, this download manager was developed, where the videos and images would be scheduled to download and store on each engineer's local machine, following the schedule and workflow established for each worker, as well as the local storage capacity of each machine.
